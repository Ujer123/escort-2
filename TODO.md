# SEO Implementation for app/page.js

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Added generateMetadata function to app/page.js to set SEO meta tags including title, description, keywords, canonical URL, robots, Open Graph, Twitter, and schema markup.
- [x] Fixed metadata structure to properly set canonical URL using 'alternates' property and keywords in 'other' object.

## Followup Steps
- [ ] Test the homepage to ensure meta tags are rendered correctly in the HTML head (e.g., check page source).
- [ ] Ensure SEO data exists in the database for 'homepage' page. If not, create it via admin dashboard or API with fields: seotitle, seodescription, metaKeywords, canonicalUrl, etc.
- [ ] Verify that the dev server is running and the page loads with metadata.
